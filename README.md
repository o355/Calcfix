# calcfix
Calcfix (or Calculator Fix) has one simple mission:
Fix your graphing calculator before class!

If you've ever been in class, and your graphing is totally messed up, or someone messed with your settings, Calcfix can fix it. Whether it's from a classmate fooling with your window settings, or a program you ran that messed something up, this will fix it, without diving through the memory window, or having to reset your calculator entirely.

This program runs entirely automatically, with only 2 inputs to hit enter at the beginning, and for a garbage collect (on the all & garbage collect programs).

On most calculators, there will be the all program, and sub-programs that can fix a certain issue if you know what the issue is, so you don't have to go through the entire fix program, which can help cut time in fixing an issue.

All programs are tested before their release to make sure everything works, as reliability is the most important thing with this program.

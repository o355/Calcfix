# calcfix
Calcfix (or Calculator Fix) has one simple mission:
Fix your graphing calculator before class!

If you've ever been in class, and your graphing is totally messed up, or someone messed with your settings, this in-dev program can fix it.

At the end, this should be compatible with the TI-73 Explorer, TI-83 Plus, TI-83 Plus Silver Editon, TI-84 Plus, TI-84 Plus Silver Edition, TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition, and TI-84 Plus CE. Compatibility for the TI-81, TI-82, TI-85, and TI-86 are to be desired.

At this point, the program is in-dev, meaning there will likely be broken code, or stuff that hasn't been done yet. Please, do not use the in-dev code, as there will be incomplete, or broken things, unless you want to.

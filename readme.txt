  Calc Fix for Color Calculators
=====================================
Created by: o355
Version: 1.3-color (6/3/2016)

=====================================
         A NOTE FROM ME:
=====================================
This is my very first TI-BASIC program.
I'm open to constructive critism, but
please, don't steal this program, or
steal any of this code. I know it's
basic code, but it took me some time to
get the hang of it, and test this.

====================
Disclaimers
====================
I cannot be responsible if this program
doesn't have your super custom settings,
or maybe reset some settings you hacked.
If you want a custom-tailored edition, ask
me. It's a one-time version custom thing.

I can't be responsible if your teacher
gets mad at you if you use Calcfix in class,
and your teacher catches you. 99.95% of teachers
will most likely be able to your feedback about
why it occured, so just tell them Calcfix is a
calculator fixing program, not a game, and you
messed up something. However, you can't point
fingers at me.

I can't be responsible if this program messes up
your calculator (best example is in versions before
1.1.2, when doing a GC reset RAM in CFXALL), so
if your RAM gets reset, or your super awesome lists,
I'm not responsible for data loss.

====================
Welcome!
====================
Calcfix is designed so you don't have to
panic after a program, or yourself screwed
up a part of your calculator. Calcfix
will in a matter of seconds have your
calculator back and running again.

====================
Installing
====================
(totally revamped)

Here's a full tutorial on how to install Calcfix.
-You'll need a USB cable, the one that came with your calc.

1. Get TI-Connect CE from the internet. Google it.
2. Install TI-Connect CE. Cool, huh?
3. Next, BE SURE TO UNZIP THIS FOLDER. Extract the .8xp files
onto your desktop or downloads folder, whatever.
4. Open up TI-Connect, and click your calculator. Not showing up?
Check your connection between the calc and your machine.
5. There's gonna be a button with a computer, and an arrow going in. Click that.
6. Select all CFX files. Let TI-Connect process stuff, it'll take a bit.
7. Now, here's the important part. If you have no launcher, make sure the programs
go into RAM. If you do, this program WORKS with launchers, you can put them in the archive.
8. Load them onto your calculator, this may take a second.
9. Done!

====================
Usage
====================
Using prgm, navigate to one of the many
programs with the prefix CFX, and open it.
Read the programs section below to get a
sense of what program is what program.

These programs can be ran archived, and
launched by Cesium, or Doors CSE (and probably
Doors CE once it comes out).

====================
Programs
====================
CFXALL.8xp will fix all the issues it can, except clearing lists, and garbage collecting.
CFXGRPH.8xp will fix all graphing issues (format, window)
CFXWIND.8xp will only fix window issues
CFXGRCL.8xp will only do a garbage collect.
CFXMODE.8xp will only fix mode issues.
CFXLIST.8xp will reset all lists.

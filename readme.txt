  Calc Fix for the TI-84 Plus CE
=====================================
Created by: o355
Version: 0.8-alpha (released 1/2/2016)

=====================================
    ALPHA SOFTWARE PRERAMBLING
=====================================
Please do note, that this is alpha
untested software. If this program messes
up your calculator, it is not my fault.
You have been warned! If you point your
finger at me for messing up your calculator,
I'll laugh at you.

Alpha software is more broken and untested then
beta software. To let you know. I haven't even
put this on a TI-84 Plus CE physically or
emulationally

====================
Welcome!
====================
Calcfix is designed so you don't have to
panic after something screwed up settings,
or graphing. 

By the way, it's pretty easy to use.

====================
Installing
====================
If you haven't already, grab yourself a
copy of TI-Connect CE, connect your
calculator via. the USB cable that came
with your calculator, and drag and drop
the Calcfix programs onto your desktop.

====================
Usage
====================
Using prgm, navigate to one of the many
programs with the prefix CFX, and open it.
Read the programs section below to get a
sense of what program is what program.

=====================================
Created by: o355
Version: 1.1.2 (4/26/2016)

=====================================
         A NOTE FROM ME:
=====================================
This is my very first TI-BASIC program.
I'm open to constructive critism, but
please, don't steal this program, or
steal any of this code. I know it's
basic code, but it took me some time to
get the hang of it, and test this.

====================
Welcome!
====================
Calcfix is designed so you don't have to
panic after a program, or yourself screwed
up a part of your calculator. Calcfix
will in a matter of seconds have your
calculator back and running again.

====================
Installing
====================
If you haven't already, grab yourself a
copy of TI-Connect CE, connect your
calculator via. the USB cable that came
with your calculator, and drag and drop
the Calcfix programs onto your desktop.

====================
Usage
====================
Using prgm, navigate to one of the many
programs with the prefix CFX, and open it.
Read the programs section below to get a
sense of what program is what program.

These programs can be ran archived, and
launched by Cesium.

====================
Programs
====================
CFXALL.8xp will fix all the issues it can, except clearing lists, and garbage collecting.
CFXGRPH.8xp will fix all graphing issues (format, window)
